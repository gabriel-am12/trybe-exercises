1 - Add an ordered list of the top 3 sites you know.\
2 - Create a file in the same directory and name it `'style.css'`.\
3 - In this .css file, add the styles so that:\
  -> The text of the `'h1'` and `'p'` tags are centered.\
  -> The background color of your list changes when the cursor is over the item.\
  -> The item's font changes when it is clicked.\
4 - Add an unordered list with at least 3 features you like.\
